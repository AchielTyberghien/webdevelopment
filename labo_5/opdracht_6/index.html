<h1>CSS</h1>
<p class="rood">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Declaration block</h2>
<p class="groen">A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon, and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or single) declaration may be used.</p>
<h3>Length units</h3>
<p class="blauw">Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation</p>
